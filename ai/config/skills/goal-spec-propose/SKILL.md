Propose a new change — create the change directory and generate all artifacts (proposal, specs, design, tasks) in one step.

When ready to implement, run `/ai-spec-apply`.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

## Working directory

Run from the workspace root — the directory containing both `ai/` and `modules/`. All paths below are relative to it.

## Steps

### 1. If no input provided, ask what they want to build

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
> "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

### 2. Create the change directory

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-propose/scripts/create-change.sh" "$name"
```

If it prints `EXISTS:`, ask the user whether to continue with the existing change or create a new one with a different name.

### 3. Check artifact status

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-propose/scripts/check-artifacts.sh" "$name"
```

### 4. Load project config (optional)

Read `ai/config/spec-config.yaml` if it exists. If present:
- `context` — apply as background to **every** artifact you generate (proposal, specs, design, tasks).
- `rules` — for each artifact you generate, apply `rules[<artifactId>]` as mandatory constraints. Valid IDs: `proposal`, `specs`, `design`, `tasks`.

If the file is absent, proceed normally (default schema is `spec-driven`).

**Constraint-vs-content rule (mandatory):** `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU — they guide what you write, but MUST NEVER appear in an artifact file. Do NOT copy `<context>` or `<rules>` blocks into proposal.md, specs, design.md, or tasks.md. They shape the content; they are not the content.

### 5. Create artifacts in dependency order

Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts. Use the **Write tool** to create each filled artifact file (write real content, not just the skeleton).

**Dependency chain** (respect this order — each artifact feeds the next):
1. `proposal.md` — no deps; establishes what & why.
2. `specs/` — depends on proposal (capabilities → spec deltas).
3. `design.md` — depends on proposal + specs (how to realize them).
4. `tasks.md` — depends on proposal + specs + design (decompose into executable tasks).

Before writing each artifact, read its dependencies for context. **After writing each artifact, verify the file exists** (Read it back or check via the tool) before proceeding to the next — a silent Write failure leaves a missing artifact that breaks `/ai-spec-apply`.

**a. Create proposal.md** (what & why) at `$change_dir/proposal.md`:

```markdown
## Why
<!-- Explain the motivation for this change -->

## What Changes
<!-- Describe what will change -->

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `<name>`: <description>

### Modified Capabilities
- `<existing-name>`: <what requirement is changing>

## Impact

### Affected Modules
- `modules/<module>`: <how it's affected>
<!-- List every module this change touches as `modules/<x>` so the apply scope
     guard (edit-roots.sh) can validate task file paths. Root-level files
     (package.json, tsconfig.json, …) are intentionally NOT roots — a task
     editing one surfaces as a scope finding for the user to approve. -->

### Other Impact
<!-- Affected APIs, dependencies, systems -->
```

Fill in the template with your analysis of the user's request. Read any existing context files for reference.

**b. Read completed proposal and create specs/**

Create one or more spec files under `$change_dir/specs/<capability>/spec.md` based on proposal analysis (use the **Write tool**; it creates parent directories as needed). A spec file is a **delta** — it describes only what this change adds, modifies, removes, or renames for that capability, not the full spec.

Use only the sections below that apply (a brand-new capability uses only `## ADDED Requirements`; modifying an existing one uses `## MODIFIED` / `## REMOVED` / `## RENAMED` as needed). **Never use `## ADDED Requirements` for a requirement that already exists** — that creates duplicates on merge; use `## MODIFIED Requirements` instead.

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: <!-- name -->
<!-- Requirement text using SHALL / MUST normative keywords -->
#### Scenario: <!-- name -->
- **WHEN** <!-- condition -->
- **THEN** <!-- expected outcome -->

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: <!-- existing name -->
<!-- The FULL replacement content (not a diff): the complete updated requirement text + all scenarios.
     Any scenario from the main spec that you omit here is DROPPED on merge, so restate every scenario
     you want to keep, then add/change the new ones. -->
#### Scenario: <!-- name -->
- **WHEN** <!-- condition -->
- **THEN** <!-- expected outcome -->

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: <!-- existing name -->
**Reason:** <!-- why it is being removed -->
**Migration:** <!-- how existing data/callers/consumers are handled — never omit, write "None" if truly N/A -->

## RENAMED Requirements
FROM: <!-- old requirement name -->
TO: <!-- new requirement name -->
<!-- If the content also changes, follow this block with a ## MODIFIED Requirements entry using the NEW name. -->
```

**Spec writing rules (mandatory):**
- Use **SHALL** / **MUST** normative keywords in requirement bodies; keep them testable.
- Every requirement MUST have at least one `#### Scenario:` (4 hashes) with WHEN/THEN.
- A delta spec touches ONE capability per file under `specs/<capability>/spec.md`.
- `## MODIFIED Requirements` provides the **full replacement** content — the merge replaces the whole requirement, so include every scenario you want to keep.
- `## REMOVED Requirements` MUST include both **Reason** and **Migration**.
- `## RENAMED Requirements` uses `FROM:`/`TO:`; if the body also changes, add a MODIFIED entry under the new name.
- Apply operations in order RENAMED → REMOVED → MODIFIED → ADDED at archive time (the archive skill enforces this).

**c. Create design.md** (how) at `$change_dir/design.md`:

```markdown
## Context

## Goals / Non-Goals
**Goals:**
**Non-Goals:**

## Decisions

## Risks / Trade-offs

## Migration Plan
<!-- Data/API/config migrations needed, in order. Write "None" if not applicable. -->

## Open Questions
<!-- Unresolved decisions that need input before or during implementation. Write "None" if clear. -->
```

Fill in the template with architecture decisions, technical approach, and trade-offs. The Migration Plan and Open Questions sections are required (write "None" when there is nothing to migrate or no open questions) so downstream tasks and reviewers can see migration steps and pending decisions explicitly.

**d. Create tasks.md** (implementation steps) at `$change_dir/tasks.md` — **use fine-grained, execution-ready task structure** so `/ai-spec-apply` can dispatch one subagent per task with everything it needs:

```markdown
# <Change Name> Implementation Tasks

**Goal:** <one sentence>
**Architecture:** <2-3 sentences>

## Global Constraints
<project-wide requirements — version floors, dependency limits, naming/copy rules — one line each, exact values verbatim from the spec. Every task implicitly includes this section.>

## 1. <Task Group Name>

### Task 1: <Component Name>

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: <what this task uses from earlier tasks — exact signatures>
- Produces: <what later tasks rely on — function names, param/return types>

**Parallelizable:** no

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (2-5 min)
- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails** — `pytest tests/path -v`, expected FAIL
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes** — `pytest tests/path -v`, expected PASS

> No commit step — in `/ai-spec-apply` neither the controller nor the implementer touches git; the user stages and commits when ready.

### Task 2: ...
```

**Task-granularity rules (mandatory):**
- Each task is the smallest unit that carries its own test cycle and a fresh reviewer's gate (2-5 minutes per step). Fold setup/scaffolding/docs into the task whose deliverable needs them.
- **Exact file paths always** (no "the appropriate file"). **Complete code in every step** that changes code. **Exact commands with expected output**.
- **No placeholders**: never write "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "add appropriate error handling", "similar to Task N" (repeat the code), or steps that describe what without showing how.
- Mark `**Parallelizable:** yes` only for tasks with no shared state and no file overlap with other tasks (enables **parallel dispatch** in `/ai-spec-apply` — independent implementers run concurrently within a wave). Default `no` for tasks that depend on earlier tasks' Interfaces. The `**Consumes:**`/`**Produces:**` blocks MUST be accurate: parallel dispatch gates on satisfied Consumes, so a wrong or missing dependency can dispatch a task before its interfaces are ready.
- Order tasks by dependency. Each task ends with an independently testable deliverable.
- Keep spec-compliance testable: each task should map to one or more spec scenarios.

### 6. Self-Review (inline quality gate)

After all four artifacts are written and verified, run this checklist **yourself** (not a subagent dispatch — this is a fresh-eyes pass over your own output, like superpowers' writing-plans Self-Review). Fix any issue **inline** before showing final status; no need to re-review after fixing.

**1. Spec coverage:** Skim every requirement and `#### Scenario:` under `specs/`. Can you point to at least one task in `tasks.md` that implements it? List any gap, then add the missing task or note the deferral explicitly in `design.md` Open Questions.

**2. Placeholder scan:** Search all artifacts for red flags — these are **plan failures** that will stall `/ai-spec-apply`'s fresh implementers (who see only their own task brief): `TBD`, `TODO`, "implement later", "add appropriate error handling", "add validation", "handle edge cases", "fill in details", "similar to Task N" (repeat the code — implementers may read tasks out of order), "the appropriate file" (use the exact path), or any step that describes *what* without showing *how* (missing code block for a code step). Fix every one.

**3. Interface consistency:** For every `Produces:` item in one task and the matching `Consumes:` item in a later task, do the names, parameter types, and return types match? A function called `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug that breaks parallel dispatch. Also confirm every type/function referenced in a later task is **defined** in an earlier task's `Produces:` (or already exists in the codebase). Fix mismatches.

**4. Delta spec legality:** Re-read each `specs/<capability>/spec.md`:
   - `## ADDED Requirements` never names a requirement that already exists in the main spec (`ai/output/specs/<capability>/spec.md` if present) — use `## MODIFIED` instead, or the archive merge creates duplicates.
   - `## MODIFIED Requirements` contains the **full replacement** (every scenario you want to keep, restated) — not a diff. Any omitted main-spec scenario is silently dropped on merge.
   - `## REMOVED Requirements` has both **Reason:** and **Migration:** (write "None" only if truly N/A).
   - `## RENAMED Requirements` has `FROM:` / `TO:`; if the body also changes, a `## MODIFIED` entry under the new name follows it.
   - Every requirement has ≥1 `#### Scenario:` with WHEN/THEN, using SHALL/MUST.

**5. Global Constraints presence:** `tasks.md` contains a `## Global Constraints` block with project-wide requirements (version floors, dependency limits, naming/copy rules) as one line each, exact values verbatim from the spec. `/ai-spec-apply` extracts this block verbatim and feeds it to every per-task reviewer — a missing or vague block means reviewers review without the project's mandatory constraints.

If the scan is clean, proceed. If you fix issues, the artifacts on disk are already updated (you edited inline) — proceed.

### 7. Show final status

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-propose/scripts/check-artifacts.sh" "$name"
```

## Output

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/ai-spec-apply $name` to start implementing."

## Artifact Creation Guidelines

- Fill in templates with real content based on the user's request and codebase analysis
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user — but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- (Dependency reading and write-then-verify are mandated in step 5 above — do not skip them)

## Guardrails
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (proposal, specs, design, tasks)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- The `.spec.yaml` metadata file is required for change tracking
- tasks.md MUST follow the fine-grained structure above (exact paths, complete code, no placeholders, Parallelizable flag) — this is what `/ai-spec-apply`'s subagent-driven execution depends on
