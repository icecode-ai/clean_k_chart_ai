Archive a completed change. Moves the change directory into the archive to keep the active changes list clean.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

## Working directory

Run from the workspace root — the directory containing both `ai/` and `modules/`. All paths below are relative to it.

## Steps

### 1. If no change name provided, prompt for selection

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-archive/scripts/list-changes.sh"
```

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

### 2. Check artifact + task completion status

Let `change_dir` = `ai/output/changes/$name` (use this path in all subsequent steps).

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-archive/scripts/check-completion.sh" "$name"
```

If the last line is `INCOMPLETE` (some artifacts missing or steps pending), display the warnings and prompt the user: "Archive anyway?" Proceed if the user confirms.

### 3. Sync delta specs to main specs (if delta specs exist)

Before archiving, check if the change has delta specs that need to be synced to the main specs directory. Delta specs contain ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED requirement sections that need to be merged into the corresponding main spec files.

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-archive/scripts/assess-delta-specs.sh" "$name"
```

**If delta specs exist**, run the idempotency check (3a), then prompt by state (3b). Only if the user chooses to sync, run validation (3c) and the atomic merge (3d).

**3a. Idempotency check — determine sync state (agent-driven)**

For each capability with a delta spec, read BOTH:
- the delta spec: `$change_dir/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
- the main spec: `ai/output/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (if it exists)

Compare each delta operation against the current main spec to classify the capability's state:
- **ADDED** requirement `X`: already applied iff main spec contains `### Requirement: X`. If `X` exists in main but its body differs from the delta's ADDED block → conflict.
- **REMOVED** requirement `X`: already applied iff main spec does NOT contain `### Requirement: X`.
- **MODIFIED** requirement `X`: already applied iff main spec's `X` matches the MODIFIED block's target content; not applied iff it still matches the pre-modification state; otherwise conflict.
- **RENAMED** `FROM: X` → `TO: Y`: already applied iff main spec contains `Y` and not `X`.

Classify each capability as:
- **Already synced** — every delta operation is already reflected in main (applying would be a no-op).
- **Needs sync** — at least one operation is not yet applied, and none conflict. (Default when the main spec does NOT exist — a brand-new capability can never be "already synced".)
- **Conflict / partial** — some operations conflict, or the state is mixed.

**Be conservative**: when uncertain, classify as **Needs sync**, not "Already synced". Only conclude "Already synced" when ALL operations are clearly already reflected.

Show a combined summary: per capability, its state + the operation counts from the script.

**3b. Prompt based on detected state**

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool**. Options depend on the combined state across all capabilities:
- **No delta specs**: skip sync entirely; proceed to step 4.
- **All capabilities Already synced**: "Archive now" (recommended), "Sync anyway", "Cancel".
  - *Archive now* → skip 3c/3d, proceed to step 4.
  - *Sync anyway* → proceed to 3c (validation mandatory) then 3d.
  - *Cancel* → abort the archive; make no changes.
- **Any capability Needs sync (none conflicting)**: "Sync now" (recommended), "Archive without syncing".
  - *Sync now* → proceed to 3c then 3d.
  - *Archive without syncing* → skip 3c/3d, proceed to step 4.
- **Any Conflict / partial**: STOP. Do not offer a blind sync. Surface the specifics (which capability, which operations, why) and ask the user to resolve the main-spec drift first (inspect manually, or re-run the change). Recommend not archiving until resolved.

**3c. Validate each delta** (only if syncing — stop and report on any error; do NOT merge a malformed delta into the source-of-truth main spec):
1. Read the delta spec file (`$change_dir/specs/<capability>/spec.md`) and the corresponding main spec (`ai/output/specs/<capability>/spec.md`) if it exists.
2. **New-capability rule**: if the main spec does NOT exist, the delta may contain ONLY `## ADDED Requirements`. Any `## MODIFIED` / `## REMOVED` / `## RENAMED` against a non-existent spec is an error — report it and stop.
3. **Reference checks**: every requirement named under `## MODIFIED` / `## REMOVED` / `## RENAMED` (the `FROM:` name) MUST exist in the current main spec. If any is missing, report the mismatch and stop.
4. **REMOVED completeness**: each `## REMOVED Requirements` entry MUST include both **Reason** and **Migration**.
5. **MODIFIED scenario-drop guard**: if the main spec's requirement has scenarios that the MODIFIED block omits, surface this explicitly ("N scenarios will be dropped") and confirm with the user before proceeding — silent scenario loss is the most common merge mistake.

**3d. Build all merged specs before writing any** (atomicity — an interrupt must not leave main specs half-merged):
1. For each capability, construct the FULL merged main spec in memory (or a temp string) by applying operations in order: **RENAMED → REMOVED → MODIFIED → ADDED**. (RENAMED first so later sections reference the new name; REMOVED before ADDED so a re-add is allowed.)
2. Only after EVERY capability's merged spec is built successfully, write them all to `ai/output/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (use the **Write tool**; it creates parent dirs as needed).
3. If any capability fails to build, write NONE of them — report the failure and leave all main specs unchanged.

### 4. Perform the archive

```bash
bash "ai/config/skills/goal-spec-archive/scripts/perform-archive.sh" "$name"
```

If the script prints `EXISTS:`, the target archive directory already exists — present the options (rename existing / delete duplicate / wait) and let the user resolve before retrying.

### 5. Display summary

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Archived to:** ai/output/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or "No delta specs" / "Sync skipped" / "Already synced (no merge needed)")
```

If there were warnings:

```
## Archive Complete (with warnings)

**Change:** <change-name>
**Archived to:** ai/output/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** Synced / Sync skipped / No delta specs / Already synced (no merge needed)

**Warnings:**
- Archived with incomplete artifacts
- Archived with N incomplete steps
- Delta spec sync was skipped (user chose to skip)

Review the archive if this was not intentional.
```

## Guardrails
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Don't block archive on warnings — just inform and confirm
- Preserve `.spec.yaml` when archiving (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and the idempotency check (3a), show the combined summary, then prompt by detected state (3b). On Conflict / partial, stop and surface specifics — do not offer a blind sync
