# Write a review package (per-repo diff vs HEAD) for a list of changed files.
# Module-aware: groups files by their owning git repo (git rev-parse --show-toplevel),
# so changes inside nested module repos (modules/*) are diffed within each module.
# No staging or commits required — tracked files use `git diff HEAD`, untracked (new)
# files are shown in full via `git diff --no-index /dev/null`. Read-only; touches no index.
#
# Usage: review-package.sh <file-list> <out-file>
#   <file-list> — file containing one path per line (relative to workspace root, or absolute)
#   <out-file>  — where to write the review package
# Prints the out-file path on success.
